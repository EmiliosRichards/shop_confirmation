Your primary task is to analyze the provided [Website Summary Text] and extract detailed company attributes. Return a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.

Based on the [Website Summary Text], extract the following information:

*   `input_summary_url`: "[Placeholder for the original URL of the company - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it. Your focus is on the attributes below based on the summary.]"
*   `b2b_indicator`: (boolean) True if the company primarily serves other businesses (B2B), False if primarily private customers (B2C), or null if unclear from the summary.
*   `phone_outreach_suitability`: (boolean) True if the company's product/service, as described in the summary, seems suitable for telephone-based acquisition, False otherwise, or null if unclear.
*   `target_group_size_assessment`: (string) Provide a qualitative assessment of the potential callable target group size based on the summary. Examples: "Appears Small", "Appears Medium", "Appears Large / >=500 potential", "Unknown".
*   `industry`: (string or null) The primary industry of the company as inferred from the summary.
*   `products_services_offered`: (list of strings or empty list) List key products or services mentioned in the summary.
*   `usp_key_selling_points`: (list of strings or empty list) List Unique Selling Propositions or key selling points highlighted in the summary.
*   `customer_target_segments`: (list of strings or empty list) List specific customer segments targeted by the company, according to the summary.
*   `business_model`: (string or null) Describe the company's business model as understood from the summary (e.g., "Service-oriented; Project-based consulting", "SaaS provider").
*   `company_size_indicators_text`: (string or null) Quote or describe textual clues from the summary that indicate company size (e.g., "summary mentions serving large enterprise clients", "described as a startup in the summary").
*   `company_size_category_inferred`: (string or null) Infer a company size category based on the summary (e.g., "Startup", "SME", "Large Enterprise", "Unknown/Not Specified").
*   `innovation_level_indicators_text`: (string or null) Quote or describe textual clues from the summary about the company's innovation level or focus (e.g., "summary highlights use of innovative workshops", "AI-supported solutions mentioned in summary").
*   `website_clarity_notes`: (string or null) Brief notes on how clearly the business model and target group are communicated, based *only* on the provided summary.

You MUST provide a value for every field listed. If you cannot determine a value from the summary, use `null` for optional fields, an empty string `""` for required string fields, or an empty list `[]` for required list fields. Do not omit any fields from the final JSON object.

Example JSON structure (ensure all fields above are included in your actual response):
{
  "input_summary_url": "[PROGRAMMATIC_PLACEHOLDER]",
  "b2b_indicator": true,
  "phone_outreach_suitability": true,
  "target_group_size_assessment": "Appears Medium",
  "industry": "Software Development",
  "industry_category": "Technology (SaaS)",
  "products_services_offered": ["Custom CRM Solutions", "Cloud Migration Services"],
  "usp_key_selling_points": ["Tailored to specific client needs", "24/7 support"],
  "customer_target_segments": ["Small to Medium Businesses", "Healthcare Sector"],
  "customer_target_segments_category": ["SMEs", "Healthcare (B2B)"],
  "business_model": "Subscription-based SaaS with consulting services",
  "business_model_category": "SaaS",
  "company_size_indicators_text": "Summary mentions a rapidly growing team and expanding client base.",
  "company_size_category_inferred": "SME",
  "innovation_level_indicators_text": "Summary highlights investment in R&D and new AI features.",
  "website_clarity_notes": "Business model and target audience are clearly articulated in the summary."
}

Remember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.
The "input_summary_url" field is a placeholder; your LLM response should generate all other fields based on the [Website Summary Text].
