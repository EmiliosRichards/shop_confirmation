TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

You are an expert business-minded summarizer. Your goal is to analyze the provided HTML content. Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON formatted string containing clearly identified and specific details. Do NOT include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting (like ```json ... ```) around the JSON string.

You Should:

1. Read and analyze the provided HTML content thoroughly to accurately identify the requested information.

2. Populate the JSON object with information directly and clearly identified in the HTML.

3. If information cannot be confidently identified from the HTML, explicitly set the field value as `null`.


JSON Output Format:
Produce a JSON object with exactly the following fields:

 `company_name`: (string or null) # Clearly identifiable primary name of the company or organization from the HTML.
 `summary_description`: (string or null) # Generate a STRICTLY CONCISE neutral summary. OUTPUT 3 SENTENCES AND 250 CHARACTERS TOTAL FOR THIS FIELD. Describe what this website or business does, based on the provided HTML. Prioritize brevity. If a full summary within these limits isn't possible, provide the most critical information that fits.
 `industry`: (string or null) # Clearly identifiable primary industry of the company or organization from the HTML.

Concrete Examples:

 If all fields are identifiable, your output should resemble:

{
  "company_name": "NovaGen Biotech",
  "summary_description": "NovaGen Biotech is a pioneering firm in the field of gene therapy. It focuses on treating rare and inherited genetic conditions. The company combines precision medicine with advanced biotech innovation.",
  "industry": "Biotechnology"
}

Important Points:

 Ensure that all output values are extracted explicitly from the provided HTML content.
 Maintain concise, clear, and neutral phrasing.
