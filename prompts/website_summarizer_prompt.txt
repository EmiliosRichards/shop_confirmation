Your primary task is to process the provided [Scraped Website Text] and return a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.

Based on the [Scraped Website Text], perform these tasks explicitly:

1. Company Summary:
  Generate an informative yet concise summary of the company, clearly capturing:
    Core business: Describe clearly what industry or field the company primarily operates in.
    Main offerings/services/products: List explicitly any core products, services, or specialized solutions prominently featured.
    Market & target audience: Clearly specify if they focus on B2B, B2C, particular industries, niche markets, or customer segments.
    Business model: Include details on their revenue model if clear from the text (e.g., subscription, consulting, SaaS, direct sales).
    Technology & special capabilities: Highlight explicitly mentioned technologies, software, frameworks, or unique capabilities featured prominently.
    Unique selling proposition (USP): Mention clearly articulated advantages, differentiators, or competitive strengths from the text.
    Mission or stated goals: Briefly summarize their stated vision, values, or strategic goals if provided.
    Keep this summary comprehensive and detailed enough to enable accurate attribute extraction in the subsequent step, with a maximum length of approximately 600 words.

2. Extracted Company Name:
  Clearly identify and extract the exact company name from the provided text. If it cannot be determined confidently, return null.

JSON Output Structure:
{
  "original_url": "[Placeholder for the original URL - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]",
  "summary": "Your detailed and informative summary here...",
  "extracted_company_name_from_summary": "Extracted Company Name or null",
}
IMPORTANT:
You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value (null for company name, empty string "" for text fields, or empty list [] for list fields), but do not omit the field itself.

Remember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown ```json blocks. The "original_url" field is a placeholder; your response must generate the other three fields based on the provided text.
